OVHHID         OVERLAP CASE: OLD HHID
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Character  Width: 6   Decimals: 0

         There are two types of overlap cases in the HRS and AHEAD. First, there were a
         number of original HRS Wave 1 households eligible to be either an HRS or AHEAD
         household. An interview was attempted for each in HRS Wave 1. Afterwards, a
         random subsampling was performed, with 60% of the cases staying in HRS and the
         remaining going to AHEAD. We refer to the 134 cases given over to AHEAD as
         HRS/AHEAD overlap. Among those 134 cases assigned to AHEAD, however, only 109
         were actually interviewed. Second, there were two cases of inter-respondent
         overlaps. In one case, an AHEAD married sample member (OVHHHID='205906' and
         OVPN='010') became widowed from his original wife (HHID='205906' and PN='020'),
         and married another AHEAD sample member (HHID='205864' and PN='010') in HRS
         1998, gaining a new identity as HHID='205864' and PN='011'. In the other, an
         AHEAD sample member (OVHHID='205399' and OVPN='010') married another AHEAD
         sample member (HHID='208545' and PN='020') in HRS 2000, gaining a new identity
         as HHID='208545' and PN='010'. The orginal information for the overlap cases was
         converted to that for the new identities. See variables OVPN, and OVRESULT for
         more information.

SECU           SAMPLING ERROR COMPUTATION UNIT
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This is the stratum half-sample code for analysis of sampling error using the
         BRR method or approximate 'two-per-stratum' Taylor Series method (Kish and Hess,
         1959). Within the SR sampling error strata, the half sample units are created by
         dividing sample cases into random halves, HALF SAMPLE CODE = 1 and HALF SAMPLE
         CODE = 2.

STRATUM        STRATUM ID
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 2   Decimals: 0

         This code is the variable which defines the sampling error computation strata of
         the HRS data. With the exception of New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago MSAs,
         each self-representing (SR) design stratum is represented by one sampling error
         computation stratum.  Due to their population size, two sampling error
         computation strata are defined for each of the three largest MSAs.  Pairs of
         similar nonself-representing (NSR) primary stage design strata are 'collapsed'
         (Kalton, 1977) to create NSR sampling error computation strata.

         This variable is used for creating household-level and respondent-level weight
         variables for each wave. It allows comparison of the HRS cohorts with the
         corresponding cohorts in the Current Population Survey.  It is constructed using
         a 'first-mention' or 'entry-wave' birth year measure. This may differ from the
         BIRTHYR variable in this file because BIRTHYR is updated on the basis of new
         information obtained in subsequent waves.

AAGE           AGE AT 1992 INTERVIEW
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

AWGTHH         1992 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 4   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1992
         containing at least one individual born in the 1931-1941 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1992 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

BAGE           AGE AT 1993 INTERVIEW
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

         In the baseline interview, all households for the wave are considered 'original'
         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a
         sub-household identifier at a particular wave even if they did not provide an

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1993
         containing at least one individual born in the 1890-1923 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1993 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a
         sub-household identifier at a particular wave even if they did not provide an

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 4   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1994
         containing at least one individual born in the 1931-1941 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1994 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a
         sub-household identifier at a particular wave even if they did not provide an

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1995
         containing at least one individual born in the 1890-1923 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1995 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 4   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1996
         containing at least one individual born in the 1931-1941 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1996 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1998
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1948. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 1998 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2000
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1948. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 2000 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See

         weight construction.

HAGE           AGE AT 2002 INTERVIEW
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

HALIVE         2002 VITAL STATUS
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

         In the baseline interview, all households for the wave are considered 'original'
         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a
         sub-household identifier at a particular wave even if they did not provide an
         interview.

HWGTHH         2002 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2002
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1948. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 2002 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

JAGE           AGE AT 2004 INTERVIEW
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

JWGTHH         2004 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2004
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 2004 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See

         weight construction.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS

         In the baseline interview, all households for the wave are considered 'original'
         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a

KWGTHH         2006 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2006
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 2006 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS

LWGTHH         2008 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2008
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the 2008 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction.

         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

MALIVE         2010 VITAL STATUS
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts. Respondents for whom vital
         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS
         1998; and for EBB is HRS 2004.

MWGTHH         2010 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2010
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the 2010 Current Population Survey (CPS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction. In this preliminary HRS 2010 release, the 2010 CPS is used
         in place of 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) for post-stratification,
         because the 2010 ACS data have not been released. For the final release, the HRS
         2010 weights will be post-stratified to the 2010 ACS.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         status was not certain are placed in two categories: presumed alive, in which
         contact was made with someone capable of reporting a death, and unknown in which
         no contact was made. By definition, no respondents can be deceased at the
         baseline interview, or they would have been excluded from the sample. The
         baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD 1993; for CODA and WB is HRS

NWGTHH         2012 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2010
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the 2010 Current Population Survey (CPS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/docs/design.html for more information about
         weight construction. In this preliminary HRS 2010 release, the 2010 CPS is used
         in place of 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) for post-stratification,
         because the 2010 ACS data have not been released. For the final release, the HRS
         2010 weights will be post-stratified to the 2010 ACS.
