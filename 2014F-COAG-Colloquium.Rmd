Optimizing Aging & Health: Methods and Applications
===
Centre on Aging Colloquium Series, Fall 2014  


The Centre on Aging (COAG) is a research intensive centre at the University of Victoria, with members 
engaged in aging research in its many forms, including both quantitative and qualitative methods, and 
longitudinal, experimental, and intervention designs. A key emphasis is on advances in the health, 
cognitive vitality, and well-being of an aging community. This colloquium series has been developed to 
highlight both substantive and methodological innovations and applications in aging research. This fall, 
our colloquium series emphasizes data management and statistical analysis using R software
(http://www.r-project.org/) and statistical models for identifying trajectories and transitions in 
longitudinal studies and administrative health data. This fall series will be of general interest to 
researchers and students who wish to increase their expertise in statistical analysis using R.    
 </br>
**This series is hosted in partnership with the Department of Psychology, Education and Training Unit of 
Population Data BC, the Island Health Research and Capacity Building Program, and and the Integrative 
Analysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging (IALSA; NIH/NIA 1P01AG043362) Research Network.**

## Lecture Summaries


**Oct 10, 2014**  
Andrey Koval (University of Victoria)  
[Toolbox and Skillset of Reproducible Research][lecture1]   
The lecture introduces reproducible research and demonstrates digital self-publishing with RStudio and Git (Hub). The skills described and emphasized in this workflow include data manipulation, graph production, statistical modeling, and dynamic reporting. A more elaborate discussion of each basic skill will be provided in the next four lectures.    

**Oct 21, 2014**    
Andrey Koval (University of Victoria)  
[RR Skills (1): Data Manipulation][lecture2]        
The lecture covers the process of importing, transforming, and saving data with R and RStudio.   
Topics: data entry and import; techniques and practices of cleaning data; organizing the data workflow; 
reshaping data; saving, storing, and exporting data.     

</br>
**Oct 28, 2014**  
Brian Flaherty (University of Washington)  
Introduction to Latent Class and Latent Transition Models: Matching Models to Questions to Data
Lecture details to follow.  

</br>
**Nov 4, 2014**  
Andrey Koval (University of Victoria)  
RR Basic Skills (2): Graph Production  
The lecture introduces the grammar of graphics and its implementation in R.   
Topics: basic R graphic utility; producing basic graphs with ggplot2; graph tuning and preparing your 
graphs for publishing.   

</br>
Nov 11, 2014    
Remembrance Day (No Presentation)    

</br>
**Nov 18, 2014**   
Andrey Koval (University of Victoria)    
RR Basic Skills (3): Statistical modeling    
The lecture introduces model fitting in R and discusses popular packages for estimating statistical 
models (lm, gls, lme4, etc.). Fitting of linear and mixed models of longitudinal data is demonstrated. 
The strategy of organizing and post-processing of the model output is discussed.   

</br>
**Nov 25, 2014**  
Andrey Koval (University of Victoria)  
RR Basic Skills (4): Dynamic Reporting  
The lecture introduces publishing with knitr and rmarkdown packages inside RStudio. A brief tutorial on 
markdown language will be provided as well as a demonstration on integrating R code into reports, and 
a discussion on the strategy of report production. Several output formats (pdf, html, slides) are 
considered.     

</br>
**Dec 2, 2014**  
Andrey Koval (University of Victoria)  
Migrating into R from other Statistical Software  
The lecture discusses the challenges and opportunities of multilingual estimation. 
Showcase: Longitudinal mixed model in syntax of R, Mplus, SAS, and SPSS. Costs and benefits of 
multilingualism in estimation. In focus: R package MplusAutomation as the means to post-process Mplus 
estimation.
